SELECT students.name as student, count(assignment_submissions.*) as total_submissions
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
WHERE students.end_date IS NULL 
GROUP BY students.name;
HAVING count(assignment_submissions.*) < 100;


The HAVING clause is like WHERE but works on aggregated data. Our WHERE clause works on normal data students.end_date and our HAVING clause works on the aggregated data count(assignment_submissions.*).
